In this program [Quiz App with Timer], there are three layers or boxes, and these boxes shown one by one on a particular button clicked. 
#At first, on the webpage, there is shown a button labeled as “Start Quiz” and when you clicked on that button, then the info box appears with popup animation.

#In this infobox, there are some rules of the quiz and two buttons labeled as “Exit” and “Continue”. 
#When you clicked on the Exit button, the info box will be hidden but when you clicked on the Continue button, then the Quiz Box appears.
# You can use this Quiz and also you can add more questions to this Quiz. In the source codes, I’ve written many comments on how you can add more questions and explained each JavaScript line of this Quiz. 
If you’re a beginner, you may have difficulties understanding the JavaScript codes but you can easily understand the HTML & CSS codes and I’ve tried to explain all JavaScript line with comments, hope you will understand.
